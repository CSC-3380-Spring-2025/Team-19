## About Our Software
WordStorm is a fun and mentally challenging collection of word games built with Flutter. It includes three games: Scattergories, LetterQuest, and Word Ladder. Each game was designed to challenge your vocabulary and problem-solving skills in a different way.

Players start from a simple game selection screen, and once a game begins, a timer tracks how quickly they complete the challenge giving the player a score. The layout is clean, the design is user-friendly, and the games are easy to pick up and play using our how to play section.
